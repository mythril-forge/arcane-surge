# Arcane Surge
> A Homebrew Spell API for D&D 5e

## Comparable Platforms
This API has comparable iterations elsewhere.
- http://www.dnd5eapi.co/
- https://api-beta.open5e.com/
- https://5etools.com/

The purpose of this specific API is to digest libraries of magic spells from other API's. Once this is done, a user can create modifications on their spells.

### Why Create an Alternative API?
The way that Nolan hosts 5th-edition D&D games is a bit different than how the original game was created. He makes slight modifications for the spells that he allows in the D&D games that he hosts. There are hundreds of spells, therefore it is neigh impossible for Nolan to keep track of these modifications without the use of additional tools.

## Usage
- Landing Page
- Import Data Page
	- Eventually, this API could have an in-house JSON spell library.
- Filter Data Page
- `CRUD` functionality
