### Why Create an Alternative?
The way that Nolan hosts 5th-edition D&D games is a bit different than how the original game was created. He makes slight modifications for the spells that he allows in the D&D games that he hosts. There are hundreds of spells, therefore it is neigh impossible for Nolan to keep track of these modifications without the use of additional tools.

## Uses
For this API to exist, it has to be able to import data from external sources. Here is API's usage flow:
1. Import pre-existing spell data in `JSON`
1. Clean and re-format spell data in `JSON` automatically
1. Create, Edit, Update, Delete data entries by hand
1. Output & Save new `JSON` data

## Brainstorming
1. Pick a Domain:
	- D&D / role-playing games
	- Chiptune Music
1. In  Domain of Interest:
	- 3 problems
		- Messy Digital Campaigning for D&D:
			- There a lot of new features that could be included with this idea
			- No open source solution
			- Current alternatives are weak
		- Chiptunes are a beautiful thing - but aren't mainstream:
			- How simple is it to make a chiptune?
			- Why are chiptunes so cool / what are they?
	- 3 solutions
		- D&D:
			- Create a map app for D&D
			- Create a diceroller app for D&D
		- Chips:
			- Create a basic music maker app based of LSDJ
			- Use machine learning to create Chiptunes
