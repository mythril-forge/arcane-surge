### Why Create an Alternative?
The way that Nolan hosts 5th-edition D&D games is a bit different than how the original game was created. He makes slight modifications for the spells that he allows in the D&D games that he hosts. There are hundreds of spells, therefore it is neigh impossible for Nolan to keep track of these modifications without the use of additional tools.
